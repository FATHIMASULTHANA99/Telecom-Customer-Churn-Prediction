# Telecom Churn Prediction Model Project

### In this GitHub repository, I've developed a Telecom Churn Prediction model employing a diverse set of algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and XGBoost.

### This binary classification problem aims to predict customer churn, distinguishing between customers who stay ('Churn: No') and those who leave ('Churn: Yes'). The dataset contains 7,043 rows and 23 columns, featuring key attributes like 'gender,' 'SeniorCitizen,' 'tenure,' 'MonthlyCharges,' 'TotalCharges,' and the target variable 'Churn.'

### After thorough experimentation, the Logistic Regression model emerged as the standout performer, boasting the highest accuracy and F1-score. This model showcases remarkable effectiveness in anticipating customer churn in the dynamic telecom industry. Feel free to explore the detailed implementation and results in this repository.
